# AES-CBC in C

This is an implementation of a symmetric cipher called **Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)** and one of the variants of the cipher - **CBC**.

I implemented a **128-bit** version of AES, which applies for:
+ **128-bit** plaintext
+ **128-bit** key
+ **128-bit** Initialization Vector (IV)
+ **10** rounds

Most of AES functions and method, I take preference in [here](https://github.com/m3y54m/aes-in-c). This Github repo also explains AES in details. In my repo I will explain how **AES-CBC** mode of encryption works.
